# Task 4.0 is to define a list with four elements
# I don't mind what values you give the elements in this
# list, as long as there are four of them i.e one more 
# than list_first had. Call this list list_second



# Task 4.1: write a print statement to access element [3]
# of list_second. If it has four elements, this shouldn't
# give you an index out of range error like you had before



# Task 4.2 is to access element [-1] of list_second.
# Compare this output to the output of the command from the 
# task 4.1. What do you notice?



# ============= Methods ===================================

# I mentioned in the homework notes that some variable types,
# such as lists, have built-in functions called methods. 
# You can find a full list of methods associated with lists 
# here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
# If you have free time after this homework, I encourage you 
# to read through the above linked website and try out one or 
# two other methods associated with lists. Some of the wording
# and notation there may seem confusing, but always the best 
# way to learn is just to mess around and try stuff out. The
# worst you'll get is an error and you and just undo and try 
# again.

# Task 4.3: we will use the append method to append the integer
# 67 to the list. Now print element [-1] of this list. What is it?



# That's it! Please go back to the notes in the issue and read the
# final part.
