# This is called a comment. Any line in Python that starts with a hash is a comment line.
# This is simply a statement intended to be read by humans only. It will be completely ignored
# by the programme itself. Comment lines are important to explain to other humans (including
# your future self) what you have done and why. It's like an instruction manual.

# ============================= PART 1 =============================

#Below we are defining a variable. The term on the left is the name of the variable (words).
# This variable is of the string type - strings are just words inside inverted commas.
# words = "I love beer!"

# Below is an alternative definition of the variable on line 10. However, in this case it is commented out.
words = "I hate beer!"

# Below is a print statement. Everything inside the curved brackets is written out to the terminal.
# In this case, we are asking it to print the variable we defined above.
print(words)

# Try pressing the play button (‚èµ) in the top right hand corner to run this code. What do you see in the terminal below?

# ============================= PART 2 =============================

# Go back to line 10 and comment it out - place a hash at the start of the line. It will now be ignored by Python when run.
# You can also toggle the commenting or uncommenting of a line by moving the cursor to that line (for example by clicking 
# on it and then pressing Ctrl+/

# Now go to line 13 and uncomment it out - remove the hash at the start of the line. Run the code again by pressing the
# play buttom. What do you see this time?

# ============================= PART 3 =============================

# Next we will define a new string variable below. You just have to give it a name (it was called words above), then an 
# equals symbol, then some text within inverted commas. It can be called anything you want and the text can be anything
# you want. Define this new variable on line 36.

arse = "poop hole surprise"

# Next, we will print out the variable we defined on line 36. Write a print statement below, similar to that on line 17.
# It should be pretty much the same, but instead of words, it'll be the name of the variable defined on line 36.
# Write this print statement on line 42.

print(arse)

# When you've done all that, press the run button again. What happens now?
