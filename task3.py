# This homework assignment is about lists

print(" ")

# ================ Definition ====================

# Let's define the list from the notes
list_first = [0, "one",  3.0]

# Let's take a look at it
print(list_first)

print(" ")

# ================ Definition ====================

# Let's look at individual elements of our list. 
# Remember from the issue description that the 
# indexing system for Python starts at zero

print("The zeroth element of the list is", list_first[0])

# As you can see, you access the n-th element of a list by putting the index in 
# square ([]) brackets. Above we are requesting element zero (0).

# Similarly, we can access the next element as such: 

print("Element one in the list is", list_first[1])


# Task3:
# Your task is to access element [3] by writing a print statement on the line below.



# When you have attempted this, go back to the issue notes
